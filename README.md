# Orbital Trajectory Simulator

This project is a basic orbital mechanics simulator that is being built in C++. My goal with this project is to simulate a satellite's motion around Earth.

## Why This Project

I am creating this project because I want to improve my C++ skills while also building a foundation in space-related software development. I know there is a lot to learn, but my goal is to create something basic and expand on it in the future as my skills improve.

Toward the bottom of this README file, I will include my project updates as I build out this simulator, and I hope that in the future, I will be able to see my growth.

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Visual Studio 2022
- Git and GitHub

## Project Updates

- [4/1/2025] I created the initial foundation of the project. I made three .cpp files and three .h files. I have also created my initial GitHub repository. The last thing I will do in this session is create this README file, which I will update throughout this project.
